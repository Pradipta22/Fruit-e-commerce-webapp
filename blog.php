            <h2>Fruit</h2>
			<div class="imgbox">
				<img src="./blogimg/Fresh Fruit.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms)
					formed from the ovary after flowering.</p>

				<p>Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds.Edible fruits, in particular, have
					propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed
					dispersal and nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a
					source of food.</p>

				<p>Accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some
					(such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.</p>

				<p>In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant
					that are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons,
					oranges, and strawberries.</p>

				<p>On the other hand, in botanical usage, "fruit" includes many structures that are not commonly called
					"fruits", such as bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.</p>

				<p>The section of a fungus that produces spores is also called a fruiting body.</p>

			<h2>Botanic fruit and culinary fruit</h2>

			<div class="imgbox">
				<img src="./blogimg/Culinary fruit.jpg">
			</div>
			<div  class="text">
				<p>Many common terms for seeds and fruit do not correspond to the botanical classifications. In culinary
					terminology, a fruit is usually any sweet-tasting plant part, especially a botanical fruit; a nut is
					any hard, oily, and shelled plant product; and a vegetable is any savory or less sweet plant
					product.</p>

				<p>However, in botany, a fruit is the ripened ovary or carpel that contains seeds, a nut is a type of
					fruit and not a seed, and a seed is a ripened ovule.</p>



				<p>Botanically, a cereal grain, such as corn, rice, or wheat, is also a kind of fruit, termed a
					caryopsis. However, the fruit wall is very thin and is fused to the seed coat, so almost all of the
					edible grain is actually a seed.</p>

			<h2>Development</h2>
			<div class="imgbox">
				<img src="./blogimg/Nectarine Fruit.jpg">
			</div>
			<div  class="text">
				<p>A fruit results from maturation of one or more flowers, and the gynoecium of the flower(s) forms all
					or part of the fruit.</p>
				<p>Inside the ovary/ovaries are one or more ovules where the megagametophyte contains the egg cell.After
					double fertilization, these ovules will become seeds.The ovules are fertilized in a process that
					starts with pollination, which involves the movement of pollen from the stamens to the stigma of
					flowers. After pollination, a tube grows from the pollen through the stigma into the ovary to the
					ovule and two sperm are transferred from the pollen to the megagametophyte.Within the
					megagametophyte one of the two sperm unites with the egg, forming a zygote, and the second sperm
					enters the central cell forming the endosperm mother cell, which completes the double fertilization
					process.Later the zygote will give rise to the embryo of the seed, and the endosperm mother cell
					will give rise to endosperm, a nutritive tissue used by the embryo.</p>

				<p>There are three general modes of fruit development:</p>
			</div>
			<div class="tags">
				<ul>
					<li>Apocarpous fruits develop from a single flower having one or more separate carpels, and they
						are the simplest fruits.</li>
					<li>Syncarpous fruits develop from a single gynoecium having two or more carpels fused together.
					</li>
					<li>Multiple fruits form from many different flowers.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Aggregate fruit</h2>
			<div class="imgbox">
				<img src="./blogimg/Lilyfruit.jpg">
			</div>
			<div  class="text">
				<p>Aggregate fruits form from single flowers that have multiple carpels which are not joined together,
					i.e. each pistil contains one carpel. Each pistil forms a fruitlet, and collectively the fruitlets
					are called an etaerio. Four types of aggregate fruits include etaerios of achenes, follicles,
					drupelets, and berries. Ranunculaceae species, including Clematis and Ranunculus have an etaerio of
					achenes, Calotropis has an etaerio of follicles, and Rubus species like raspberry, have an etaerio
					of drupelets. Annona have an etaerio of berries.</p>
				<p>The raspberry, whose pistils are termed drupelets because each is like a small drupe attached to the
					receptacle. </p>

			<h2>Multiple fruits</h2>
			<div class="imgbox">
				<img src="./blogimg/Apporabana.jpg">
			</div>
			<div  class="text">
				<p>A multiple fruit is one formed from a cluster of flowers (called an inflorescence). Each flower
					produces a fruit, but these mature into a single mass.Examples are the pineapple, fig, mulberry,
					osage-orange, and breadfruit.</p>
				<p>In the photograph on the right, stages of flowering and fruit development in the noni or Indian
					mulberry (Morinda citrifolia) can be observed on a single branch. First an inflorescence of white
					flowers called a head is produced. After fertilization, each flower develops into a drupe, and as
					the drupes expand, they become connate (merge) into a multiple fleshy fruit called a syncarp.</p>

			<h2>Berries</h2>
			<div class="imgbox">
				<img src="./blogimg/Noni.jpg">
			</div>
			<div  class="text">
				<p>Berries are another type of fleshy fruit; they are simple fruit created from a single ovary.The ovary
					may be compound, with several carpels. Types include (examples follow in the table below):</p>
				<div class="tags">
					<ul>
						<li>Pepo – berries whose skin is hardened, cucurbits</li>
						<li>Hesperidium – berries with a rind and a juicy interior, like most citrus fruit</li>
					</ul>

			<h2>Seedless fruits</h2>
			<div class="imgbox">
				<img src="./blogimg/Dish.jpg">
			</div>
			<div  class="text">
				<p>Seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce. Commercial cultivars of bananas and
					pineapples are examples of seedless fruits. Some cultivars of citrus fruits (especially grapefruit,
					mandarin oranges, navel oranges), satsumas, table grapes, and watermelons are valued for their
					seedlessness. In some species, seedlessness is the result of parthenocarpy, where fruits set without
					fertilization. Parthenocarpic fruit set may or may not require pollination, but most seedless citrus
					fruits require a stimulus from pollination to produce fruit.</p>
				<p>Seedless bananas and grapes are triploids, and seedlessness results from the abortion of the
					embryonic plant that is produced by fertilization, a phenomenon known as stenospermocarpy, which
					requires normal pollination and fertilization.</p>

			<h2>Seed dissemination</h2>
			<div class="imgbox">
				<img src="./blogimg/seed diss.jpg">
			</div>
			<div  class="text">
				<p>Variations in fruit structures largely depend on their seeds' mode of dispersal. This dispersal can
					be achieved by animals, explosive dehiscence, water, or wind.</p>
				<p>Some fruits have coats covered with spikes or hooked burrs, either to prevent themselves from being
					eaten by animals, or to stick to the feathers, hairs, or legs of animals, using them as dispersal
					agents. Examples include cocklebur and unicorn plant.</p>
